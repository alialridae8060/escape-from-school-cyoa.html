# Escape from School.
## Content: My goal was to make a game with my partner(William Gomez) through Github with my basic knoweledge of HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) that is somewhat on the shelkf on my mind thanks to the teachings of Mr.Muller the teacher for tenth grade SEP(Software Engineering Program) class at myu school Hstat(High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology).
## My partner and I,decided to make the game as we were asigned escape from school sow we decided why not make a game of it.It is based on a kid who decided whereter he should ask to use the bathroom or go drink water.We worked hard to make this project and to make sure all the componets needed would get us a good grade.
## One of the challenges we faced on how would the game end as it took us some time to decide how would the game end.Another challnege was that we faced was that we had to be careful with typos as there was no auto correct.Through this project I learned the importance of timing as me and my partner had to get things done before the deadline or we be in trouble.Alon with that I learned how to adapt with working with other people.Finally through out this project I was able to become more creative.I'm glad I took this project as I saw it as an opprotunity for life lessons I would use again soon.
